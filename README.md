Telco Customer Churn Prediction Using Random Forest ðŸŒ²ðŸ“‰
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn for a telecom company, based on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to help telecom providers proactively identify customers at risk of leaving.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview
Objective: Predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic and service usage data.
